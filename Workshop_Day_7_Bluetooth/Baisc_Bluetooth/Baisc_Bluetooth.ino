    /* JY-MCU Bluetooth Wireless Serial Port module for Arduino®
    
    ON and OFF Control of a LED thru Bluetooth .
    The code example will switch ON or OFF on board LED by sending command ‘B’
    or any other character thru the Bluetooth paired PC or Laptop.
    
    The pins used are designed are for JY-MCU Bluetooth Wireless Serial Port
    module with Arduino® Uno Board available from:
