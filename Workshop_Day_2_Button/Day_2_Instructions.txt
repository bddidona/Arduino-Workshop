Arduino Workshop Instructions - Day 2:

	This day of the arduino workshop participants will learn a few topics:
		1) Button - a variable resistor, and how it can be used to control a...
		2) basic coding- it is important to understand the code in this as the basics of coding such as if-then statements, and loops are used!
		3) timing - understand that the arduino can save the time that things happen, and then use that time to see if a certain amount of time has passed.
		4) LEDs - you want some light right? Make sure to plug the right ends into the positive or negative side!
