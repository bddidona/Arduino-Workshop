The first day of the workshop will include the following:

1) Installing the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE, Fancy term for where to write code)
2) Learn how a breadboard works
3) Learn about Ohms Law V=IR, and how the Arduino works


Procedure: 

1) Download the Arduino IDE for your operating system. You can download the IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.
	Note: If you have any issues, double check you downloaded the IDE for the correct operating system.

2) Learn Ohms Law! Basics will be covered in the workshop.
