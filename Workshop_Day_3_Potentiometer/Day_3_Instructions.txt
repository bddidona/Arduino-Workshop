Arduino Workshop Instructions - Day 3:

	This day of the arduino workshop participants will learn a few topics:
		1) Poteniometer - a variable resistor, and how it can be used to control an LED's brightness.
		2) Serial communication: The communication standard the arduino uses to talk to your computer! 
		
	Once you have the LED & Potentionmeter hooked up open up the serial monitor! shortcut: Control + Shift + M
	You should see the number changing as you turn the potentiometer! the values should range from 0 to 255.
		
	The coolest thing about this, is a joystick is literally just 2 potentiometers! 1 for the Y axis and one for the X axis!
	
	Note:the potentiometer may be different from the one in the image. The main take away is that the "variable" pin of the potentionmeter is connected to the analog read pin.
