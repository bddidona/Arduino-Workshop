Arduino Workshop Instructions - Day 3:

	This day of the Arduino workshop participants will learn a few topics:
		1) Potentiometer - a variable resistor, and how it can be used to control an LED's brightness.
		2) Serial communication: The communication standard the Arduino uses to talk to your computer! 
		
	Once you have the LED & Potentiometer hooked up open up the serial monitor! Shortcut: Control + Shift + M
	You should see the number changing as you turn the potentiometer! The values should range from 0 to 255.
		
	The coolest thing about this is a joystick is literally just 2 potentiometers! One for the Y-axis and one for the X-axis!
	
	Note: the potentiometer may be different from the one in the image. The main take away is that the "variable" pin of the potentiometer is connected to the analog read pin.
