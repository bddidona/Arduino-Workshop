Arduino Workshop Instructions - Day 8:

	This code will allow you to control the remote control car via the android app called "Arduino Bluetooth Controller".
	The app can be found at the following URL: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.giumig.apps.bluetoothserialmonitor
	
	To use this application to control the car first make sure the motors are connected using the same way they were from Day 6 when the vehicle was being driven using a joystick.
	Please note you may need to change the arduino pins! Also make sure that the bluetooth device is on.
	
	Once the vehicle is ready, and the app has been downloaded, open the app and select the HC-06 device which you connted to in workshop day 7. 
	Once connected, the application will ask how you want to contorl the vehicle, select controller mode!
	
	Once in controller mode go into the top right of the screen and press the three dots. This will bring up a menu for the data to send when buttons are pressed. Enter the following data for each button:
	
	^ = W
	< = A
	> = D
	V = S
	
	Start = X
	Select = Z
	
	Once entered, and the bluetooth device and vehicle are connected you can begin to control the vehicle!
	Just press Start, and then press the arrow keys! If you want to stop the vehicle press select. To restart the vehicle you need to press Start again.
	
	If you want to get fancy controls put the following in for the other buttons in controller mode:
	
	Square = AAW
	X = DDW
	
	Add As and Ds to turn more! Thats it, enjoy :)
