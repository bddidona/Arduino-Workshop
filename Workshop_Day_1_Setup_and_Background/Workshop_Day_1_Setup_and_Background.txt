The first day of the workshop will include the following:

1) Installing the arduino Integrated Development Environment(IDE, Fancy term for where to write code)
2) Learn how a bread board works
3) Learn about Ohms Law V=IR, and how the arduino works


Procedure: 

1) Download the Arduino IDE for your operating system.You can download the IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.
	Note: If you have any issues, double check you downloaded the IDE for the correct operating system.

2) Learn Ohms Law! Basics will be covered in the workshop.
