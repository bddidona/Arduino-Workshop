Arduino Workshop Instructions - Day 4:

	This day of the Arduino workshop participants will learn a few topics:
		1) Joystick: this is nothing but two potentiometers and a button!
		2) Serial communication: Again, this simply prints out the values read in by the joystick
		
	Note that the analog read pins are used for potentiometers, while the button (which is digital) is used on the digital pins of the Arduino!
